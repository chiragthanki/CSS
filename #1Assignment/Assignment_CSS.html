        <h3>Q. Name a few CSS style components</h3>
        <p>Ans.
        <ul class="ul">
            <li>Selector: class name, id name or element name that is target</li>
            <li>Attribute: name of the attribute you want to style for example border, color,background, position etc.
            </li>
            <li>Value of Property: value that will be assigned to attribute.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h3>Q. What do you understand by CSS opacity?</h3>
        <p>Ans. The opacity CSS property sets the opacity of an element. Opacity is the degree to which content behind
            an element is hidden, and is the opposite of transparency.</p>
        <hr>

        <h3>Q. How can the background color of an element be changed?</h3>
        <p>Ans. To change the background-color of any element, just give style to it as below. <br> <br>
            &emsp;element(tag) name <br>
            &emsp;{ <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;background-color: color-name; <br>
            &emsp;}</p>
        <hr>

        <h3>Q. How can image repetition of the background be controlled?</h3>
        <p>Ans. To control the background repetition, we can use <strong>background-repeat</strong> property. </p>
        <hr>

        <h3>Q. What are the various formatting tags in HTML?</h3>
        <p>Ans. -The background-position property takes two values: the horizontal position and the vertical
            position. These values can be specified in different units, such as pixels, percentages, or keywords
            like "top", "bottom", "left", and "right". <br> <br>
            â€”The background-position property in CSS is mainly used to sets the initial position for the
            background image.
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h3>Q. Which property controls the image scroll in the background?</h3>
        <p>Ans. -The "background-attachment" property can take two values: "scroll" and "fixed". <br><br>
            &emsp;-body { <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;background-image: url('image.jpg'); <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;background-attachment: fixed; <br>
            &emsp;}
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h3>Q. Why should background and color be used as separate properties?</h3>
        <p>Ans. -The background and color properties are used to define the background color and text color of an HTML
            element, respectively. While it is possible to use the background-color property to set both the background
            color and text color of an element, it is generally recommended to use the background property for setting
            the background color and other related properties such as background-image, background-repeat, etc.
            separately <br> <br>
            -Using separate properties for background and color makes the style sheet more legible and easier to
            maintain. The background property is complex in itself, and combining it with the color property can make it
            even more complex.
        </p>

        <h3>Q. How to center block elements using CSS1?</h3>
        <p>Ans. <br> &emsp;element selector { <br>

            &emsp;&emsp;margin: 0 auto; <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;text-align: center; <br>
            &emsp;}
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h3>Q. How to maintain the CSS specifications?</h3>
        <p>Ans. The Specification defines how CSS properties should be implemented by browser vendors along with
            detailed algorithms, code samples and tabular information. <br><br>
            The Specification also include:
